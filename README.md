# Ecosystem graphs

This repository contains the information that powers ecosystem graphs for
foundation models (e.g., GPT-3).
Briefly, an ecosystem graph is a graph where nodes are **assets**
(e.g., datasets, models, and applications)
and directed edges represent dependencies between assets
(e.g., model trained on a dataset, application powered by a model).

We welcome community contributions to this repository.
To contribute, please submit a PR.

To visualize and explore the ecosystem graphs, start a local server:

    python server.py

and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
