  description: HowTo100M is a large-scale dataset of narrated videos with an emphasis
    on instructional videos where content creators teach complex tasks with an explicit
    intention of explaining the visual content on screen. HowTo100M features a total
    of 136M video clips with captions sourced from 1.2M Youtube videos (15 years
    of video) and 23k activities from domains such as cooking, hand crafting, personal
    care, gardening or fitness.

  modality: text (English) and video
  size: 136M video clips
  sample: []
  analysis:
    value: Authors use the dataset to learn a joint text-video embedding by leveraging
      more than 130M video clip-caption pairs. They then evaluate the learned embeddings
      on the tasks of localizing steps in instructional videos of CrossTask and
      textbased video retrieval on YouCook2, MSR-VTT and LSMDC datasets. They show
      that their learned embedding can perform better compared to models trained
      on existing carefully annotated but smaller video description datasets.
    explanation: See [[Experiments]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03327v2.pdf#section.5)
  dependencies: [YouTube]
  included:
    value: Authors are primarily interested in "visual tasks" that involve some
      interaction with the physical world (e.g. Making peanut butter, Pruning a
      tree) as compared to others that are more abstract (e.g. Ending a toxic relationship,
      Choosing a gift). To obtain predominantly visual tasks, they limit them to
      one of 12 categories. The authors also restrict to the top 200 YouTube search
      results, as the latter ones may not be related to the query task.
    explanation: See [[Data collection]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03327v2.pdf#subsection.3.1)
  excluded:
    value: Authors exclude categories such as Relationships and Finance and Business,
      that may be more abstract. Videos with less than 100 views are removed. Authors
      also ignore videos that have less than 100 words. Videos longer than 2,000
      seconds are removed. As some videos may appear in several tasks, they deduplicate
      videos based on YouTube IDs.
