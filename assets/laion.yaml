    explanation: The date the [[blog post]](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) was
      released. Note that the dataset was already compiled earlier, eg. the Stable
      Diffusion model released earlier was trained on a subset of LAION-5B

    value: All samples with less than 5 characters alt-text length or less than
      5 KB image size are dropped. All images with the too big resolution, potentially
      DOS bombs, were dropped before attempting to process them. Duplicate removal
      is performed with a bloom filter based on URL. Future runs would include more
      variate deduplication rules, such as URL + language for the multilanguage
      dataset. We use CLIP respectively MCLIP to compute embeddings of the image
      and alt-text. Then we compute the cosine similarity of both embeddings and
      drop all samples with cosine similarity below 0.28 for the English language
      ( with CLIP B/32) and 0.26 for the multilingual dataset (MCLIP). These thresholds
      were selected based on human inspection of the test results. We use the CLIP
      embeddings of images and texts to filter out to the possible extent the illegal
      content.

    value: Full public access
    explanation: The dataset index is available from https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/

    explanation: The license is listed on the [[dataset blog post]](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/)
  intended_uses: The authors recommend using the dataset "for research purposes"
    and "do not recommend using it for creating ready-to-go industrial products,
    as the basic research about general properties and safety of such large-scale
    models, which we would like to encourage with this release, is still in progress"
  prohibited_uses: No uses are explicitly prohibited by the licens. Users are warned
    from using LAION-5B for non-research purposes.
