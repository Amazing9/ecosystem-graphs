  description: >
    The family of datasets used to train Cohere models, which come in two forms:
    coheretext-filtered, coheretext-unfiltered. The former is used to train the
    Representation models, while the latter one is used to train the Generation
    models.
  created_date:
    2021-11-15; The date the Cohere API was announced on the news

  license: >
    Unknown; The dataset likely has a license specifically for Cohere's use.
  included: >
    As stated in the datasheet, the dataset "includes the Google Books dataset,
    CommonCrawl, and text from the internet scraped by the Cohere infrastructure
    team." The top ten domains scraped were: wordpress.com, medium.com,
    stackexchange.com, tumblr.com, elsevier.com, genius.com, bbc.co.uk,
    libsyn.com, yahoo.com, nytimes.com

  excluded: >
    Documents that are not in English are excluded.
  quality_control: >
    In the datasheet, it is implied that Cohere employs filtration methods for
    removing racist, biased and toxic content, but the details are not provided.
    These filtration methods take both the context and the language, as opposed
    to using a list of blockwords
