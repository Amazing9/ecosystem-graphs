      GitHub is working on a filter to detect and suppress code generations that
      are verbatim from the training set
      [[GitHub Research Recitation]]
      (https://docs.github.com/en/github/copilot/research-recitation).
      According to the FAQ, GitHub implemented a simple filter that blocks emails
      in standard formats to protect personally identifiable data that may be
      present in the training data
