    The GPT-3 dataset is the text corpus that was used to train the GPT-3
    model. Information on the GPT-3 dataset is limited to discussion in the
    paper introducing GPT-3
    [[Section 2.2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf#subsection.2.2).

  analysis: >
    The GPT-3 paper, which also introduces the GPT-3 dataset, provides a limited
    analysis on the GPT-3 dataset, reporting the dirtiness of the dataset after
    the it was filtered for text occurring in common benchmarking tasks.
    The authors report that "as the dataset becomes more contaminated, the
    variance of the clean/all fraction increases, but there is no apparent bias
    towards improved or degraded performance"

    The dataset is composed several NLP corpora: Common Crawl (filtered, 60%),

    [[Section 2.2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf#subsection.2.2).

    The Common Crawl dataset was processed using a classifier that kept high
    quality documents and filtered low quality documents. WebText was used as a
    proxy for high quality documents
    [[Appendix A]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf#appendix.A).
  quality_control: >
    In addition to excluding low quality documents from the Common Crawl
    dataset, the authors fuzzily deduplicated documents within each dataset, by
    removing documents that have high overlap with each other. The same
    procedure was followed to fuzzily deduplicate WebText from Common Crawl
    [[Appendix A]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf#appendix.A).
    Text occuring in benchmark datasets were also partially removed

  # General

  description: >
    "CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) is a neural network trained
    on a variety of (image, text) pairs. It can be instructed in natural
    language to predict the most relevant text snippet, given an image,
    without directly optimizing for the task, similarly to the zero-shot
    capabilities of GPT-2 and 3. We found CLIP matches the performance of the
    original ResNet50 on ImageNet “zero-shot” without using any of the original
    1.28M labeled examples, overcoming several major challenges in computer
    vision"

    30 days; The exact training time of CLIP depends on the vision and language
    encoders used: "The largest ResNet model, RN50x64, took 18 days to train
    on 592 V100 GPUs while the largest Vision Transformer took 12 days on 256
    V100 GPUs. For the ViT-L/14 we also pre-train at a higher 336 pixel
    resolution for one additional epoch to boost performance ... Unless
    otherwise specified, all results reported in this paper as “CLIP” use this
    model which we found to perform best"

    The authors found that the performance of the model depended heavily on
    which classes are included (and excluded) for a given task. They reported
    significant race and gender based disparities on the Fairface dataset,
    depending on how the classes were constructed. The authors also demonstrated
    that the model was capable of racial profiling with high accuracy

    "Any deployed use case of the model - whether commercial or not - is
    currently out of scope. Non-deployed use cases such as image search in a
    constrained environment, are also not recommended unless there is thorough
    in-domain testing of the model with a specific, fixed class taxonomy.
    This is because our safety assessment demonstrated a high need for task
    specific testing especially given the variability of CLIP’s performance
    with different class taxonomies. This makes untested and unconstrained
    deployment of the model in any use case currently potentially harmful.
    
    Certain use cases which would fall under the domain of surveillance and
    facial recognition are always out-of-scope regardless of performance of the
    model. This is because the use of artificial intelligence for tasks such as
    these can be premature currently given the lack of testing norms and checks
    to ensure its fair use.

    Since the model has not been purposefully trained in or evaluated on any
    languages other than English, its use should be limited to English language
    use cases"
